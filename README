My portable vim configuration, including the plugins I like and use.

First, clone the repo and the submodules:
    git clone https://github.com/NevilleS/vim.git --recursive ~/.vim

Now edit your ~/.vimrc file to source:
    source ~/.vim/vimrc

Alternatively, if you don't want to clobber your .vim directory (e.g. you are on Windows and don't want to touch that),
clone the repo somewhere else (e.g. $HOME/vim):
    git clone https://github.com/NevilleS/vim.git --recursive $HOME/vim

Now edit your platform's .vimrc file (e.g. on Windows edit $VIM/_vimrc) and add the following:
    set rtp^=$HOME/vim
    source $HOME/vim/vimrc
