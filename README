My portable vim configuration, including the plugins I like and use.

First, clone the repo and the Vundle submodule:
    git clone https://github.com/NevilleS/vim.git --recursive ~/.vim

Now edit your ~/.vimrc file to source:
    source ~/.vim/vimrc

Now run :PluginInstall to have Vundle pull in all the other plugins
    vim +PluginInstall +qall
