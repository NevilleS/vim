My portable vim configuration, including the plugins I like and use.

First, clone the repo and the submodules:
    git clone https://github.com/NevilleS/vim.git --recursive

To install, clone this repo to ~/.vim and add a symlink:
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Or just edit your ~/.vimrc file to source:
    source ~/.vim/vimrc
